# WebScraping
## The point of the this project was to take curl the information from two webpages, in this case Riteaid and Albertsons, and to create a website using similar items on each. It would download all the information on similar items and can regulary update the information my webpage. People can shop normally on my page, and when an item is selected, it shows the selected item with the counter stores related item and finds the best deal. The website charges a small markup to bring in profit. All purchases and store items are stored in a local database. When curling the websites, the old versions of the files are deleted and the new ones become xtml files.
